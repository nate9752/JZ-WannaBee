General sizing code for remote control aircraft. Project manager:
Nate Carey

This code will serve as the mothership for all sizing related calculations
simulations for our remote controlled aircraft project. We hope to create
a geometric visualization tool for our aircraft, an in-depth propulsion 
database, a thorough aerodynamic analysis section, and controls 
calculations. 

I hope that this code can be made robust enough to help size aircraft for 
multiple projects. This readme will be updated as time goes on (maybe).
